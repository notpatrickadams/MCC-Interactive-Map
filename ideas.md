# To-Do List

* ~~SQLite Database~~
  * ~~Columns:~~
    * ~~CRN~~
    * ~~RoomNumber~~
      * ~~For CRNs with multiple rooms, there will be separate rows in the table~~
    * ~~CourseName~~
* Interactive Map in HTML
  * ~~Created buttons for 'A' and 'B' rooms~~
  * Use HTML canvas
  * ~~Look for another Javascript library~~ Not necessary
  * ~~Create a way to choose which room if multiple rooms apply to a CRN~~ Multiple rooms attached to CRN requires the user to know the room number
  * Warn users if the selected CRN is online only, off site only, in a different building, or in multiple rooms
    * Display the name of the building
  * Create a function to find the nearest hallway depending on the current floor and current coordinates
    * Draw lines to match exact X or Y coordinates of the hallway
* ~~Web Scraper with BS4 & Requests in Python~~
  * ~~Scrape from sis.ccsnh.edu~~
  * ~~Possibly look for another way to get room numbers from CRNs~~ Not necessary
